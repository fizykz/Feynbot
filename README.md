# Feynbot

A smarter Discord bot.  Feynbot is written for hackers.  People who know how to code, know what they want, and know they don't have enough time to bother.  Feynbot is completely written in Python and is file based.  This means that everytime you want to write a command, event, or anything else, all you need to do is copy-paste a file, and make the adjustments you need for it.  Feynbot also makes permissions and checks easier by handling all the boiler plate code for you.  But the best part?  It's that every single command, event, change, can be handled completely differently based on what guild it's in, the channel it's from, or the user created it, while all remaining file based.  This means that you have full customizability over your servers, while keeping it simple.
